    "bio":"I've been coding since 2018, starting off with languages such as C++, C#, Java, HTML, and CSS, although I've decided to focus on C# after discovering its object-oriented programming style, along with how clean the language is. I've also developed quite a few applications such as POS and other small scale personal applications, while I've started to dabble with web development in 2022.",
